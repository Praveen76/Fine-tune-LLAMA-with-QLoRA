# Fine-tune-LLAMA-with-QLoRA

## Overview

This repository provides an implementation of the fine-tuning process for Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically LLAMA, using the QLoRA (Quantized Low Rank Adaption) method. ]

**QLoRA** stands for **Quantized Low Rank Adaption**. It is a new approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that uses less memory while maintaining speed. QLoRA works by first quantizing the LLM to 4-bits, reducing the model’s memory footprint significantly. The quantized LLM is then fine-tuned using the Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) approach. QLoRA is a versatile technique applicable to different language models, including RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, enabling researchers to explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning for various LLM architectures. QLoRA was developed by members of the University of Washington's UW NLP group.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- torch
- transformers
- datasets
- peft
- accelerate
- bitsandbytes
- trl
- safetensors
- ipywidgets
- huggingface_hub

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Fine-tune-LLAMA-with-QLoRA.git
   cd Fine-tune-LLAMA-with-QLoRA
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and prepare the LLAMA model:

   ```bash
   # Add instructions to download and prepare the LLAMA model
   ```

4. Fine-tune LLAMA with QLoRA:

   ```bash
   python fine_tune_llama.py --config config.yaml
   ```

   Make sure to customize the configuration file according to your requirements.

## Configuration

The configuration file (`config.yaml`) allows you to specify various parameters for the fine-tuning process, including data paths, model hyperparameters, and QLoRA-specific settings.

```yaml
# Add sample configuration parameters and explanations
```

## Results

Include information about the performance metrics and results obtained after fine-tuning LLAMA with QLoRA. You may want to provide comparisons with baseline models or alternative fine-tuning methods.
